Here I try to recreate the schematics and layout of the nixie clock from this nice instrucables creator:
http://www.instructables.com/id/simple-user-adjustable-DIY-Nixie-Clock/

Please note that I am not done yet

The reason for me doing so is so that I can generate gerber files with wich I or you can easily order the pcb istead of echtching it oneself :)
If you Andrea Biffi (The creator of the original plans on wich I base my on) want me to remove this respority for a reason, please contact me and I 
will do so.
